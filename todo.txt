Great! Building your own IDE is a fantastic learning project. Here's a **step-by-step plan** for implementing an IDE from scratch, starting from zero, in **priority order**‚Äîfrom trivial UI needs to more advanced features:

---

## üß± **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Editor Basics**

These are the foundational features you *must* implement first.

### 1. **Basic GUI and Window**

* App window with a title bar
* Menu bar (File, Edit, View, etc.)
* Status bar (optional but common)
* Basic layout system (e.g., editor pane + sidebar)

### 2. **File I/O**

* "Open File‚Ä¶" dialog
* Read file content into editor
* Save file ("Save" and "Save As‚Ä¶")
* Show file name on the title or tab

### 3. **Basic Text Editor**

* Text input and rendering
* Cursor support
* Arrow key navigation
* Mouse click to move cursor
* Backspace and delete keys
* Newlines and line breaks

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è **Phase 2: Editor Usability Features**

Now improve the editing experience.

### 4. **Text Selection & Clipboard**

* Click and drag to select text
* Shift + arrows for keyboard selection
* Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V / Ctrl+X
* Undo/Redo

### 5. **Line Numbers & Scrolling**

* Line numbers on the side
* Vertical scrolling for long files
* (Optional) Horizontal scrolling

### 6. **Tabs or Multiple Files**

* Allow opening multiple files in tabs or side-by-side
* Each tab keeps its unsaved state

---

## üé® **Phase 3: Developer Features**

Now start turning it into an actual IDE.

### 7. **Syntax Highlighting**

* Basic tokenization (keywords, comments, strings)
* Language-specific rules (e.g., for Python or JavaScript)

### 8. **Search and Replace**

* In-file text search (Ctrl+F)
* Search all files (more advanced)
* Replace (optional at this stage)

### 9. **Build/Run Integration**

* Button or hotkey to run a command (e.g., `python current_file.py`)
* Show output in a terminal/console pane
* Configurable build/run commands per file type

---

## üêû **Phase 4: Advanced IDE Features**

These make your IDE powerful.

### 10. **Error Highlighting**

* Show syntax errors (based on language parser or subprocess output)
* Underline or color invalid code

### 11. **Autocomplete**

* Simple keyword completion
* Later, integrate with a language server (LSP)

### 12. **Debugger Integration (optional, advanced)**

* Set breakpoints
* Step through code
* Variable inspection
* Requires language-specific support (e.g., GDB for C, pdb for Python)

### 13. **Git Integration (optional, advanced)**

* Show changed files
* Commit, push, pull from inside IDE
* View diffs

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Bonus/Polish Features**

Not essential, but polish your IDE.

* Theming (light/dark)
* Font size and spacing options
* File explorer sidebar
* Workspace saving/loading (remember open files and window state)
* Split view editing

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Tech Stack

Depending on your preferred language:

### If using Python:

* GUI: `tkinter`, `PyQt5`, or `dearpygui`
* Text rendering: `tk.Text`, `QPlainTextEdit`
* Syntax highlighting: `Pygments`, or custom regex-based
* Terminal: `subprocess` + a scrollable text widget

---

If you want, I can help scaffold the first window and editor widget too. Would you like that?
